## Installing PyTorch Geometric and RDKit

- **PyTorch Geometric**: For building graph neural networks (GNNs).
- **RDKit**: For handling molecular data.
- **torch-scatter**: Provides efficient scatter operations for PyTorch tensors, essential for aggregating or distributing data across nodes in a graph structure.
- **torch-sparse**: Optimized for handling sparse matrices in PyTorch, crucial for GNNs where adjacency matrices are often sparse.
- **torch-cluster**: Includes clustering algorithms optimized for PyTorch, useful for tasks like node clustering or neighborhood sampling in graph processing.
- **torch-spline-conv**: Implements spline-based convolutional layers for graph data, enhancing GNNs by applying convolutional operations with spline functions to capture complex node relationships.
- **DeepChem**: DeepChem is a machine learning library specialized in scientific applications, particularly in the field of chemistry.
